# Updating GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

Follow these steps to update the SSH key in your GitHub repository secrets:

## 1. Copy Your Private SSH Key

Run the following command in PowerShell to display your private key:

```powershell
type C:\Users\rgedam\.ssh\gcp_deploy_key
```

Copy the entire output, including the `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` lines.

## 2. Update GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" (tab at the top)
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Find the `GCP_SSH_KEY` secret and click on "Update"
5. Paste the entire private key content you copied in step 1
6. Click "Update secret"

## 3. Verify Other Secrets

Make sure these other secrets are also set correctly:

- `GCP_HOST`: `35.226.143.5` (your GCP VM IP address)
- `GCP_USER`: `roshangedam1998` (your GCP VM username)
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Your MySQL root password
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth client secret

## 4. Trigger a New Workflow Run

After updating the secrets, trigger a new workflow run:

1. Make a small change to any file in your repository
2. Commit and push the change to the `master` branch
3. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow run

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you still encounter SSH issues:

1. Check the workflow logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that the SSH key has been added to your GCP VM by running the `add_ssh_key_to_gcp.sh` script
3. Test the SSH connection locally using the `test_ssh_connection.ps1` script
